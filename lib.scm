Creates a list of numbers in the range specified.

Arguments
  start: number: optional (default 0). The number to start at.

  in the list.

Returns
  A list of numbers starting at 'start', incrementing by 'step', and

  exactly 'stop' if all three arguments are integers. Otherwise it will

#!
Declares a setup symbol-binding.

Arguments
  sym: symbol: a symbol by which to refer to the bound value.

  expr: any: a value to bind to the symbol above. This value may later
  be accessed from any test in the same suite by calling the test's
  'environment' (usually e) with the symbol. E.g., (e 'sym).
!#
(define-syntax setup
  (syntax-rules ()
    ((_ sym expr)
      (cons sym (lambda () expr)))))

(define tests list)

#!
Declares a test.

Arguments
  desc: string: a description of the test.

  env: an 'environment' (an alist of names and bindings) that is passed
  in to the test. Two types of names are defined:

    1. Names always automatically defined by ggspec before running the
    test: 'assert-equal, 'assert-not-equal, etc. These are defined by
    ggspec automatically because they depend on the suite options like
    where to send test runtime messages to.

    2. Names defined by the test writer by setting up names and
    corresponding values in the suite setup section. The corresponding
    values are evaluated anew each time a test is run, which is why in
    the setup section you have to wrap each value up inside a thunk.

  expr: a value returned by one of the above assertion functions. An
  expression that makes up the body of the test. This will be wrapped
  inside a function and the function will be passed in the 'environment'
  env from above.

  opts: same type as in 'suite', above. Optional (default is no
  options).

Returns
  (list desc opts func): a three-member list of the test description,
  the options passed in to the test, and the unevaluated function making
  up the body of the test.
!#
(define-syntax test
  (syntax-rules ()

(define teardowns list)

#!
Declares a teardown.

Arguments
  expr ...: any number of expressions.

Returns
  A thunk containing all the expressions above, ready to be evaluated.
